The data from this site contains the Atlantic Hurricane Outlooks from May of each year. This data will be used in comparison against the primary hurricane tracking data, in order to analyze which years had accurate predictions. Another secondary dataset that will be used and added manually to an existing table also comes from the National Hurricane Center site. This data consists of the U.S. damage costs (in millions). This information will be analyzed and used to justify if accurate hurricane predictions lead to saving costs. "
